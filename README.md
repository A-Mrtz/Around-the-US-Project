### Overview  

* Description 
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Description**
  
This is my first project working with Figma and being able to fully delve into what I've learned previously. This project contains elements of Media Queries, Grids, Flex elements and a Responisve Design.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
